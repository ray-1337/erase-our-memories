A script to slowly mass-delete your messages from your, well, ex?

I hate that I kept remembering shit days from my ex. So, this script is enough to get rid of my mind.

## Tutorial
- Do `npm install`
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill `.env` keys with needed values.
- You can grab Discord token by just go through inspect element.
- Run `node index`
